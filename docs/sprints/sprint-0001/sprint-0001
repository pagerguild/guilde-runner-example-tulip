Convert the existing application from Electron to Tauri.

## Milestones
Work on each milestone in sequence. Do not skip ahead.

### Milestone 1 - Infer a PRD
- Research the existing code and create a PRD through inference.

### Milestone 2 - E2E testing
- Develop e2e testing that confirms the current behavior of the PRD
- The testing strategy must not use Electron-specific tools.
- The testing strategy must be able to test the same app after switching to Tauri

### Milestone 3 - Convert the app to Tauri
- Replace Electron with Tauri
- Ensure the e2e tests pass

## Acceptance Criteria
- The app builds and run properly without errors
- The e2e tests pass against the current Electron version
- The e2e tests pass against the new Tauri version
